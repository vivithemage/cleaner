1. Ignore .part files, may not want this moving as it is not a complete file, so if 'funnydonkey.mpg.part' exists, 
don't move it or 'funnydonkey.mpg' as it's probably the user is in the process of downloading and not all of the 
file is present.

2. Find a c/c++ library to parse metadata of a file. So something that would allow for

  get_created_date(*file_pointer) 
  get_size(*file_pointer) 
  get_author(*file_pointer)

2. Neural network (perhaps fann) to 'learn' directory contents and place files relating to characteristics 
observed in directories.

3. Add QT ui option but allow for both cli and gui.

4. Don't use autotools etc, use scons instead.

6. Choose an xml parser and writer: libxml2 seems a good choice.
