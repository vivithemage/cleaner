Magic Cleaner

Description
-----------

Magic-cleaner: Through the use of the magic library, files are sorted into directories according to the users specification.
Basically, if there's a directory full of files (as there often is particularly with download directories), the cleaner software 
should sort them all into each folder according to type.

A nice progression would be to train an artificial neural network (ANN) to look for patterns in folders and then sort accordingly. 
A simple example would be pdf's in the directories "ebooks" and "invoices". A file sorter that went on file type alone would stuff 
both of these in a folder for pdf's but a trained ANN should be able to learn the distinction. 
For example, learning the filesize was larger in the book directoy.

Version history
---------------

31/11/12 - Version 0.02

Completely forgot about this, found the code.

31/05/10 - Version 0.01

Basic functionallity, moves all image files into a different directory.  However, the directories are hardcoded, so the next 
step is to add text input block for the directory to be sorted and where sorted files should go, aswell as some eyecandy.
