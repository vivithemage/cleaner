Description

Magic-cleaner: Through the use of the magic library, files are sorted into directories according to the users specification.
Basically, if there's a directory full of files (as there often is particularly with download directories), the cleaner 
software should sort them all into each folder according to type.

Version history

31/05/10 - Version 0.01

Basic functionallity, moves all image files into a different directory. However, the directories are hardcoded, so the next step is to add text input block for
the directory to be sorted and where sorted files should go, aswell as some eyecandy.

Notes

TODO

1. Ignore .part files, may not want this moving as it is not a complete file, so if 'funnydonkey.mpg.part' exists, don't move it or 'funnydonkey.mpgi'.
